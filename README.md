# BART Locations San Francisco

This is a map in San Francisco. You can type keyword in search input filter the items and see detail of what you want to visit. Click the item in the search list or markers on the map and then detail will show. 

Download the project, and then `npm install`. After install running `gulp serve` and copy `http://localhost/` to view the web.


Note:
I can't directly use yelp api, so I put it in the api.js and you can visit it by http://localhost:8888;
